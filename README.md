# CSGO.ai competition
This repository contains documentation and some tools for the [CSGO.ai](https://csgo.ai) challenge.

By participating in the CSGO.ai challenge you agree to the terms and conditions
of the challenge, which can be found in `terms.pdf`.

## Dataset
The initial data set consists of ~500 demos from high level tournament play
in 2019 and 2020. Warmup rounds and restarts have been filtered, and for the
remaining live rounds a round snapshot have been recorded every 20 seconds
until the round is decided.

[The dataset can be downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XcWtU8C9VvPKW2RrCp7ZSqkzleUmT5Mh).

## Visualizer
We have added a small python program that can visualize the round snapshots,
which might be useful for debugging and feature engineering. It can be found
in the `visualizer` folder.

## Data format
The data is in JSON, generated by [serde](https://serde.rs) with default
settings. Below is the data structures in Rust, annotated with information that
might be helpful to understand the data.

We have also provided a small jupyter notebook that shows how to load and
perform simple analysis on the data. It needs tensorflow 2.1 to run, which can
either be installed manually, or by installing [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) and
running `run_jupyter.sh`.

If you find any errors or bugs in the dataset, data format or documentation,
then please open an issue.
